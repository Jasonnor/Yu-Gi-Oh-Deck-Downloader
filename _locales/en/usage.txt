Hi all, I wrote a simple Chrome extension for downloading decks
Yu-Gi-Oh-Deck-Downloader

Use as follows:
1. Install the linked Chrome extension
2. Go to https://ocg.xpg.jp/deck/deck.fcgi
3. Click on the deck you want to download (e.g., https://ocg.xpg.jp/deck/deck.fcgi?ListNo=268211)
4. Click "Yu-Gi-Oh Card Button" in the upper right corner of the browser to download the deck, or open the right-click menu, and then click "Download Deck".
5. Move the downloaded *.ydk file to "[Your ADS directory]/deck/"
6. Open YGOPro and you will see the downloaded deck

This Chrome extension is an open-source project. It's actually quite simple. If you have any suggestions or bugs, please feel free to create issues or send a PR. Thanks a lot!
